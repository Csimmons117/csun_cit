### Apache CloudStackâ€™s Pod Setup Lab 01

CIT 360 Solutions is setting up labs for new IT students to gain experience at the beginning of their careers through a program called "Evil Training." Everything the company uses is hosted on a single rack. This rack contains four servers and a network gateway, all of which are pre-configured.

The previous IT team managed to mess things up so badly that the Executive Committee (ECO) fired them for failing to set anything up properly. You and your team have been hired to fix everything and get it running smoothly.


### What should you do?

1. Make a documentation of all the machines in the rack. Sometimes is helps to draw out a network topology of everything that you need to work on and see how its all connected. (IP range, cables, machines os, gateway)

1. Wipe everything on the servers and the gateway.

1. Make sure each lab meeting you take a picture of all members at are working.
