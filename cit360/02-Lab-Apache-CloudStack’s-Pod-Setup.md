### Apache CloudStackâ€™s Pod Setup Lab 02

CIT 360 Solutions is happy to see that the *"Evil Training"* program is showing some good improvement for certain students. However, after setting up the newly provisioned ESXi servers, the system administrator is frustrated with having to use different IP addresses to access each server. The administrator is looking for a solution that allows centralized management of all the ESXi servers, making it easier to work on all the servers in the rack for the *"Evil Training"* program.



### What should you do?

1. Make sure each lab meeting you take a picture of all members at are working.

1. Take pictures of the process of installing and configuring the machines.

1. [Download](https://vmpatch.com/) the VCenter installer to help manage the esxi servers.
