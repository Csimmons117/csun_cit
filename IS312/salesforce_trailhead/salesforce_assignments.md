- You may submit your screenshot directly in Canvas, or copy and paste the screenshots into a Microsoft Word document; Name the document as Salesforce Trailhead
Assignment # followed by your full name and save it.

- Follow the Canvas submission instruction to upload the document in Canvas as the
evidence of you have completed the designated Salesforce trailhead assignment.

- Please understand one of learning objectives of the Salesforce assignment is to follow the right procedures and guidelines to work on, complete, and submit a designated IT

practice on.
