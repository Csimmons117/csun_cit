- When you complete a Salesforce Trailhead assignment, you should be able to see the
badge(s) and completed activities you have completed of the assignment.

- Make a screenshot of each page showing your profile name, completed activities, and
badges.

- You may submit your screenshot directly in Canvas, or copy and paste the screenshots into a Microsoft Word document; Name the document as Salesforce Trailhead
Assignment # followed by your full name and save it.

- Follow the Canvas submission instruction to upload the document in Canvas as the
evidence of you have completed the designated Salesforce trailhead assignment.

- Credit points may be deducted due to missing the said screenshots or not following the submission instructions.

- Please understand one of learning objectives of the Salesforce assignment is to follow the right procedures and guidelines to work on, complete, and submit a designated IT
artifact on IS concepts and/or applications. This will be part of life being an IT
professional and that we want our students to have some preparation, training, and
practice on.
