**Exercise 2: Microsoft OS Environment Vulnerability Analysis (20 Points)**

**Learning Objectives and Outcomes**
▪ You will learn how to analyze a mixed-version Microsoft Windows environment and to
identify the issues described in Microsoft Security Advisories.

**Assignment Requirements**
You are reviewing the security status for a small Microsoft Domain LAN. The Domain contains
many distinct separations in the network as determined by group memberships. The network
consists of computers working on a variety of client platforms, such as Windows 10, and
Windows11, and Windows Server 2022 products in a single environment. An example of the
network divisions is as follows:
▪ **Windows laptops:** Traveling salespeople, remote suppliers, branch offices
▪ **Windows desktops:** Accounting group, developer group, customer service group
▪ **Windows servers:** Administrative server, Microsoft SharePoint server, Server Message
Block (SMB) server

Microsoft Common Vulnerability and Exposures (CVEs) are addressed through security
advisories with a corresponding advisory ID. Other CVE sources attach a CVE ID to advisories.
Answer the following questions based on the advisories for the past 12 months:

1. What are the benefits of Managed Vulnerability Scanning?
2. What vulnerabilities exist for this workgroup LAN based on the advisories? List five of
    them.
3. Do any vulnerabilities involve privilege elevation? Is this considered a high-priority
    issue?
**4.** Identify and document at least three vulnerabilities and the solutions related to the
    client configurations.

**Resources**

**1. Microsoft Security Response Center**

**https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security-updates/**

**2. National Vulnerability Database**

NVD is the U.S. government repository of standards based vulnerability management data
represented using the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP). This data enables
automation of vulnerability management, security measurement, and compliance. NVD
includes databases of security checklists, security related software flaws, mis-configurations,
product names, and impact metrics.

▪ You will learn how to determine the impact of a data classification standard on an
organization's IT infrastructure.
**Assignment Requirements**
You are a networking intern at Richman Investments, a mid-level financial investment and
consulting firm. Your supervisor has asked you to draft a brief report that describes the
“Internal Use Only” data classification standard of Richman Investments. Write this report

affected. In your report, mention at least three IT infrastructure domains affected by the
“Internal Use Only” data classification standard. Your report will become part of an executive
summary to senior management.

**Exercise 4: Match Risks/Threats to Solutions (10 Points)**
