    --Username (a text field)
        o The user should enter only lower-case letters in this field, or the entry is invalid.
        You may optionally check this while the user is typing or when the field is blurred,
        but either way you must check this at form-submission time.
    -- Password (a password field, <input type=”password”>)
        o The user should enter a password containing a mix of upper-case and lower-
        case letters and numbers (at least one of each, or the entry is invalid). Other
        characters are allowed but optional. You may optionally check this while the user
        is typing or when the field is blurred, but either way you must check this at form-
        submission time.
    Student ID number (a text field)
        o The user should enter a 9-digit number. No letters are allowed or the entry is
        invalid. The number must be exactly 9 digits long to be valid. You may optionally
        check this while the user is typing or when the field is blurred, but either way you
        must check this at form-submission time.
