Hello everyone! I created this repo because I wasn't satisfied with the professor's vague instructions for the labs and wanted a place where we could help each other succeed. I also wanted to create something that would last longer than a discord so future classes can use this knowledge to help them.


## FAQ

> How do I contribute to the GitHub

There is a great guide [here](Misc/GitHub%20Setup.md) that covers how to configure your GitHub as well as basic commands.

> "I'm running into an error while working on the lab, what should I do?"

Follow these steps:
1. Don't panic.
1. Double check the instructions to make sure you are following them exactly[^1]. If you are using a different Linux distro or Windows edition than I am using, or using different software, you may get different results than I did.
1. If there is an error code, look it up.
1. Check for OS/application updates to Linux & Windows Server.
1. Restart the affected VMs.
1. If none of the above solve the issue, then reach out to the discord or shoot me a DM and I'll see what I can do to help you.

[^1]: That's not to say you can't try a different way. These assignments are open ended and can be done any number of ways. Frankly I'd love to see someone come up with different ways to complete the labs. Just don't be surprised if you deviate from the instructions and run into an error.

> "You made an error/there's missing information in your instructions."

Great catch! Please create a pull request with the updated information and I will update it as soon as I can.

> "I solved the lab a different way."

Type out your instruction on a .md file and either send it to me directly or upload it via a pull request.
