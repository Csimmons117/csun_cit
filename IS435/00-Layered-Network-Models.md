### The Overview of Layered Network Models

#### Network Communication
1. What is a network?
    - The most basic form of a network is two computers connected through a LAN cable.
2. What is network communication?
3. How can two (or more) devices communicate with each other?

#### What is Layered Network Model?
- Describes how all aspects of a communication problem can be partitioned into pieces that work together.
1. Cooperative sets (Suites or families)
2. Each protocol handling a part of communication
3. Managing the complexity
4. Being complete and efficient

#### Internetworking with (Hybrid) TCP/IP

- The U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) in 1973
- To develop communication protocols
- “Internetting project” ➔ Internet
- TCP/IP Protocol Suite
- Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) / Internet Protocol (IP)

#### Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Model

- The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1977
- To develop general standards and methods of networking
- Published in 1980s
**Why would the ISO develop this open system model?**


#### OSI Model vs (Hybrid) TCP/IP Model
The OSI seven-layer model The TCP/IP Model

| OSI | TCP/IP |PDU                          
|-----|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| Applicatiion | Application | Data or message |
| Presentation | -           |                 |
| Session      | -           |                 |
| Transport    | Transport   |  Segment        |
| Network      | Network     |  Packet         |
