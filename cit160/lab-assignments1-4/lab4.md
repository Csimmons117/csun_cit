### Setup a type 1 hypervisor

Setup the pod computers, with a Type 1 hypervisor (i.e. VMware EXSI). Setup virtual networking, with a Windows Server, a Windows Client, and a Linux Client. Configure Active Directory, DNS, DHCP, and two of the following (File and Storage Services, Web Server IIS, Print and Document Services, Windows Server Update Services, Volume Activation Services, Remote Desktop Services, Remote Access, Hyper-V, and/or Host Guardian Service). Share files among all the OS's.

Take 4 screenshots of the Server installation, and 4 screenshots for the setup of each client and detail the challenges that you have encountered. Submit one report for each pod group with all participating students names and recent pictures **(anyone that doesn't participate in the lab should not be included, otherwise the entire group will receive a zero on the lab).** Weekly pictures required with names listed in order.
