### Setting up the computers

Setup the pod computers, two Windows 10 desktops, and one Windows Server 2019. Configure Active Directory, DNS, DHCP, and two of the following (File and Storage Services, Web Server IIS, Print and Document Services, Windows Server Update Services, Volume Activation Services, Remote Desktop Services, Remote Access, Hyper-V, and/or Host Guardian Service). Create multiple user types and share different files on each type and change the windows background depending on the user type.

Needs to be completed in the lab. Take 4 screenshots of the Server installation, 4 screenshots of the Windows 10 installation, and a couple screenshots for each services installed and detail the challenges that you have encountered. Submit one report for each pod group with all participating students names and recent pictures **(anyone that doesn't participate in the lab should not be included, otherwise the entire group will receive a zero on the lab).** Weekly pictures required with names listed in order.
