Take 4 screenshots of the Server installation, and 4 screenshots for the setup and detail the challenges that you have encountered. Submit one report for each pod group with all participating students names and recent pictures (anyone that doesn't participate in the lab should not be included, otherwise the entire group will receive a zero on the lab).
